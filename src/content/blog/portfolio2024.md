Since I started in the world of programming, I worked in the niche of web video
games, but really I was also a web programmer, I had studied HTML and CSS on my
own, so at a certain point I decided to make an original website from scratch.
It was a "retro" site according to me, not that I didn't know how to make a more
complex UI, but I wanted to show the information without too many detours and
with responsive design.

This is what my first website looked like. That light blue was horrible, and the
contrast was probably -15, but at the time I didn't give it much importance,
since what I was interested in was that the right links were there. Eventually I
decided to give it a redesign:

Here we can see an evolution of the same website, some better colors, we still
had the navigation in a list of links, but it looked better, I remember a friend
told me that making this website was too basic and easy. I never really changed
it, I didn't care much about it.

But I got tired of it, I wanted to have a website up to par, something that made
a little more sense, fuck me, I'm supposed to be a web developer, how could I
have such a low level? So I decided to start mocking up an idea.

At that time I was just starting to use Trello, so I thought it would be cool to
organize things this way, okay, yes, the images were extremely bizarre, I was
supposed to change them. Then I decided to incorporate orange as the color of
the page, at least in the mock-ups it looked good.

Then I started to use a more round style, thinking well, this is what I usually
use, it fits with my font, and well, I like it.

I coded up the design using the framework [Lume](https://lume.land) to generate
static websites, and what were the boards ended up becoming a sidebar, and well,
the result was the following:

It was missing things, a section to see all the projects, I didn't really like
my profile section, and I felt it was too basic. Also, there had been problems
with scalability and code, so I decided to completely change the design.

- The orange was very ugly, and it was difficult to match.
- I didn't like the sidebar, it wasn't very functional.
- There was no dark mode

So, first I decided to anchor myself to a design system, and well, I went for
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) along with the
[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) component library. I also decided to read the
book by the creators of Tailwind, [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com).
This gave me a lot of information on how to make good designs, and since the
frameworks themselves are prefabricated so that you have to be stupid to make
bad designs with them, I ended up with this:

I changed the colors, being the main color purple, a much easier color to
combine in general. I also decided to change the description, finally add a
section for projects, career and some nice buttons, using Iconify icons. I'm
satisfied, I feel I got a good website, and it's also extensible, something that
the previous one lacked.
